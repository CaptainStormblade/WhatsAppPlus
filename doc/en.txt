* Added a keyboard shortcut that opens a list of all WhatsAppPlus keyboard shortcuts. By default, this function is assigned to ALT+H gesture.
* Fixed a bug where ALT+2 and ALT+3 gestures didn't work.
* Fixed a bug where it was impossible to activate some functions from the context menu using gestures.
* Fixed an issue where changing voice message playback speed and pausing voice message playback did not always work.
* Fixed a bug where in chats when focusing on your sent messages, instead of the word "you", the screen reader announced a personal number. To avoid this, you need to specify the phone number in the WhatsAppPlus settings and after that the add-on will not report it on your messages.
* Fixed an issue where WhatsAppPlus prompted to update on secure screens. To prevent this from happening again, you need to click on the "Use currently saved settings during sign-in and on secure screens (requires administrator privileges)" button in the NVDA general settings.
* The gesture to accept a call has been changed to ALT+shift+Y, and the gesture to decline a call has been changed to ALT+shift+N. This is to ensure that these gestures do not conflict with UnigramPlus gestures.
* Microphone and camera on/off gestures during a call now work correctly.
*Removed gesture to set reaction to messages, since in the latest versions of WhatsApp, reactions are available directly from the context menu.
